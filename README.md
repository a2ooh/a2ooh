- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @a2ooh

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Applied Statistics. I am currently focused on using my background in Applied Statistics and experience working with languages such as R, Python, SAS, 
and SQL to acquire am entry-level, full-time position as a Data Analyst. In the future, I hope to learn more about machine learning (I have some rudimentary 
experience with machine learning models in R and Python (Pandas)) as I am leaning in that direction for the future of my career.  

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my knowledge of Python, R, and SQL. I work with these daily and will continue to do personal projects in an effort to expand my fluency. 
I am also currently learning new topics such as data visualization with Tableau and PowerBI. I have plenty of experience with data visualizaiton in Python and R, but 
am now just developing my skill set with the two afformentioned apps. 

- ðŸ“« The best way to reach me would be through LinkedIn.
