- 👋 Hi, I’m @a2ooh

- 👀 I’m interested in Applied Statistics. I am currently focused on using my background in statistics and experience working with languages such as R, Python, SAS, 
- and SQL to acquire am entry-level, full-time position as a Data Analyst. In the future, I hope to learn more about machine learning (I have some rudimentary 
- experience with machine learning models in R and Python (Pandas)) as I am leaning in that direction for the future of my career.  

- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge of Python, R, and SQL. I work with these daily and will continue to do personal projects in an effort to expand my fluency. 
I am also currently learning new topics such as data visualization with Tableau and PowerBI. I have plenty of experience with data visualizaiton in Python and R, but 
am now just developing my skill set with the two afformentioned apps. 

- 📫 The best way to reach me would be through LinkedIn.
